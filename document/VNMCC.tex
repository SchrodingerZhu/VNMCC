\chapter{Introduction}
In CUHK(SZ) and many other universities, writing an MIPS CPU with pipeline is a required work for the  architecture courses. However, most teaching materials just provide students with some basic concepts of CPUs and do not give essential introductions on languages or the potential difficulties of the implementation.
Writing this book, we want to achieve the following goals:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Give a detailed description on each part of the MIPS CPU.
	\item Clarify how we can write a sequential logic circuit, avoiding oscillations and other problems.  
	\item Introduce Clash, a higher level HDL that can generate synthesizable Verilog files and reduce the complexity of development. 
\end{itemize} 

We are \textbf{NOT} going to implement a fully functional MIPS CPU. Instead, we will only structure some skeletons that can help us understand the concepts and principles. We hope our readers can gain some basic knowledge of hardware design and the Clash language from this book.

\chapter{Advanced Topics}
\section*{Constraint Trick with \mintinline{haskell}{-XPartialTypeSignatures}}
\textbf{This part is provided by dramforever.}

Tired of writing all the \mint{haskell}{HiddenClockResetEnable dom, NFDataX a, Num a, Eq a} constraints? Just enable \mintinline{haskell}{-XPartialTypeSignatures} and \mintinline{haskell}{-Wno-partial-type-signatures} then replace all your constraints with a \mintinline{haskell}{_}.

Before:

\begin{minted}{haskell}
foo 
  ::
( HiddenClockResetEnable dom
     , Num a, Default a, NFDataX a
     )
  => a -> a -> a
  -> Signal dom a
  -> Signal dom a
\end{minted}

After:

\begin{minted}{haskell}
foo 
  :: _
  => a -> a -> a
  -> Signal dom a
  -> Signal dom a
\end{minted}
\section*{Synthesize Annotation Trick}
\textbf{This part is provided by dramforever.}

Have you ever found yourself writing \mintinline{haskell}{Sythesize} annotations like this:

\begin{minted}{haskell}
{-# ANN f Synthesize
    { t_name   = "f"
        , t_inputs = [ PortName "a"
        , PortProduct "" [ PortName "b", PortName "c" ] ]
        , t_output = PortProduct "res" [PortName "q"]
    } #-}
\end{minted}

And thought, maybe there's a less verbose way. Well, look no further than \mintinline{haskell}{-XOverloadedLists} and \mintinline{haskell}{-XOverloadedStrings}

\begin{minted}{haskell}
instance IsString PortName where
  fromString = PortName

instance IsList PortName where
  type Item PortName = PortName

  fromList = PortProduct ""

  toList = error "toList for PortName is not implemented"
\end{minted}

Now we can just write:

\begin{minted}{haskell}
{-# ANN f Synthesize
    { t_name   = "f"
        , t_inputs = [ "a", [ "b", "c" ] ]
        , t_output = PortProduct "res" [ "q" ]
    } #-}
\end{minted}

Isn't that just like, way more readable?

Note that these are indeed orphans so you might want to put \mintinline{haskell}{{-# OPTIONS -Wno-orphans #-}} in whatever file you are defining these instances.

\section*{Applicative Do-Block}
Sometimes, if you are describing some combinatorial logic within signal, it may be useful to use Applicative Do-Block. You need to enable the ApplicativeDo language extension:
\begin{minted}{haskell}
test :: Signal System Bool 
     -> Signal System Bool 
     -> Signal System Bool 
     -> Signal System (Bool, Bool)
test signalA signalB signalC = do
  a <- signalA
  b <- signalB
  c <- signalC
  return (a && b, b || c)
\end{minted}
This is transformed into the following thing:
\begin{minted}{haskell}
(\a b c -> (a && b, b || c)) <$> a <*> b <*> c
\end{minted}
Be aware that Signal is not a Monad Instance. Even though you can use some basic logic structures, these do blocks are highly limited: you can not use let-binding or apply some complicated functions at the middle way.
\chapter{GtkWave}
In the test bench, we have already shows the functions to dump VCD files. The dumped results can be used in a software called GTKWave to provide visualization of the circuit state.

Invoke Icarus Verilog generated simulation executable and you will get the monitor output together with a VCD file.

You can open the file with GtkWave and get a screen like this:
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.18]{gtkwave0}
	\caption{GtkWave Screenshot}
\end{figure}

Using the tree view on the left-hand side, you can choose the signals to display, for example, the following screenshot shows the graph of our toy CPU under several clock cycles:

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{gtkwave1}
	\caption{GtkWave Display}
\end{figure}

If you want to use GtkWave to debug the circuits, it is recommended to store the configuration so that you do not need to select the signals to display each time you open the program.

\chapter{Sample Output}
Let us create a nonsense assembly file which involves stalling and forwarding:
\begin{minted}[linenos]{asm}
lw $t0, 4($zero)
addi $t0, $t0, 1
lw $t1, 8($zero)
addi $t1, $t1, 1
sw   $t0, 4($zero)
sw   $t1, 8($zero)
sub  $t0, $t0, $t0
xor  $t1, $t1, $t1
beq  $zero, $zero, 0
addi $t0, $t0, 1
addi $t1, $t1, 1
j 114514
\end{minted}
This file is translated into the following binary form:
\begin{minted}[linenos]{text}
10001100000010000000000000000100
00100001000010000000000000000001
10001100000010010000000000001000
00100001001010010000000000000001
10101100000010000000000000000100
10101100000010010000000000001000
00000001000010000100000000100010
00000001001010010100100000100110
00010000000000001111111111110111
00100001000010000000000000000001
00100001001010010000000000000001
00001000000000000110111111010100
\end{minted}
The output is shown in the following files:
